## 👨‍💻 Development & Contribution

### My Role

I personally **built the entire project** from conception to deployment, including design, development, and adherence to all best practices mentioned above.

### Setup Instructions

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/BonaventureCJ/portfolio.git](https://github.com/BonaventureCJ/portfolio.git)
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

**Note:** For the contact form to function, you will need to configure a service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and set the corresponding endpoint in your environment variables or component code.

### Future Enhancements

I have the following improvements planned for the project:

* **TypeScript Migration:** To enhance code quality, predictability, and maintainability by introducing static typing.
* **Backend Integration:** To add a simple backend once I complete my study of backend technologies, allowing for more complex features (e.g., dynamic content, custom API).
